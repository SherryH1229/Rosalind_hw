# Rosalind_hw

These are my current solutions to the Rosalind Bioinformatics (CSE/BIMM 181)
Though I am very fond of the Biopython and Numpty packages, I tried to write every function based on the basic python (No import of libraries) 
I generally worked this homework with Python 2.7 

Most of the homework should be bugless except some of the homework (which I do not remember)
Good luck on course and wish you like Pavel
